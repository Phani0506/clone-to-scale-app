      "question": "What is the core idea behind Retrieval-Augmented Generation?",
      "ground_truth": "The core idea of RAG is to first retrieve relevant information from a specific knowledge base and then provide this context to a Large Language Model along with the user's query to generate a factual, context-aware answer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the main components of a neural network?",
      "ground_truth": "A simple neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, all made up of interconnected nodes or neurons."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary benefit of using RAG over just fine-tuning a model?",
      "ground_truth": "The primary benefit of RAG is that it is a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning that helps make Large Language Models more accurate by grounding them in specific, up-to-date information."

    {
      "question": "What is a key component of an LLM-powered autonomous agent system?",
      "ground_truth": "A key component is memory. This includes short-term memory for in-context learning and long-term memory, which gives the agent the ability to retain and recall information over extended periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
      "ground_truth": "Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the desired output is known, while unsupervised learning involves finding patterns and structures in unlabeled data without a predefined output."
